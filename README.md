# Steganography

Steganography is a method of encoding data that allows the user to hide messages or other forms of data inside other data types.
Data hiding is the protection of detection which is what this project focuses on, by hiding informationin images.
Steganography can prevent data leakage by hiding the intended information within a seemingly innocent piece of data.
